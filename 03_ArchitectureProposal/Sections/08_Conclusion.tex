Electronic voting systems are still an active area of research and a playground from which some important cryptographic concepts have been derived. It has evolved around the technology that supports it, which has transitioned this research area to a new age regarding the fundamental approach considered, thanks to its recent integration with blockchain technology.
\par
This proposal presents a decentralised, remote electronic voting system that takes advantage of the properties of Non-Fungible Tokens, as well as the Flow blockchain and its Resource-Oriented Paradigm. The organisation and features offered by this new approach support the design of a private, secure, transparent, verifiable, and mobile voting system whose proof of concept is to be derived from the strategy presented in this text.
\par
This also proves the suitability of the NFT concept as a transport mechanism within public networks.
\par
This paper defines a concrete road map to produce a working prototype to prove the implementation of the set of security criteria in Section \ref{stateoftheart}, as a strategy to achieve a truly secure and remote electronic voting system. Another important aspect that determines the usability of this proposal is scalability; specifically, what are the limits of the supporting blockchain regarding the scope of operation of this system.
