\subsection{Contract-based vs. Account-based Blockchains}
\label{sec:contract-to-account-storage}
Contract-based blockchains store NFT metadata relative to the address of the NFT-implementing contract, often through an address-to-NFT-id mapping. For account-based blockchains such as Flow, NFTs are always and uniquely stored in an account-based location, which can be the minting contract account (address to where the NFT contract was deployed), another contract, or a user account.
\par
In a contract-based blockchain, the information of every NFT minted by a contract is always visible in the deployed contract code, and the contract contains all information related to the NFT, as well as the structures that implement its ownership. Deleting a contract from the blockchain permanently erases all NFT information, including metadata and ownership records.
