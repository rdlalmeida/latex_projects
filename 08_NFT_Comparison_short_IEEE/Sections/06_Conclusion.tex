\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
This paper presents an implementation analysis for two distinct architectures to create NFT-based contract capable of minting and transferring these tokens between users. Ethereum and Flow were chosen for this exercise due to former's role as a reference, general-purpose, and very popular blockchain, the latter being a blockchain created with the specific purpose of solving known issues with the Ethereum chain, namely, by supporting high throughput and scalable NFT projects.

Flow is quite younger than Ethereum and, because of this, is still under some development and missing a wider spectrum of applications when compared to a more mature Ethereum. Nevertheless, Flow provides more than enough capabilities to produce a NFT-capable contract. If anything, the structural analysis done in Sec. \ref{sec:flow_blockchain} reveals Flow as the more complex, but also more configurable blockchain. From a programmatic point of view, Cadence is syntactically more complex than Solidity and contracts consume more time to develop, but the deployment process is quite
