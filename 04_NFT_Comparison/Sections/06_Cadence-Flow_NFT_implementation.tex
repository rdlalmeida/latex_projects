\section{Cadence-Flow NFT Implementation Details}
\label{sec:cadence_flow_nft_implementation}
Flow's version of the ERC721 standard is simply named the \textit{NonFungibleToken} standard and is defined by a contract interface file with same name, specifically, the importable \verb|NonFungibleToken.cdc| file. Contract interfaces in Flow/Cadence work very similarly to the ones in Ethereum/Solidity: these files define a set of default functions, internal parameters, events and resources (the main change from Ethereum/Solidity mappings)
